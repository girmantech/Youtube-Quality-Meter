# YouTube Quality Meter Chrome Extension

This Chrome extension enhances your YouTube viewing experience by displaying the like-to-view ratio directly on the video thumbnails. Built using React 18 and Webpack 5, this tool helps you filter out low-quality content by providing immediate insights into the community's reception of videos.

## Philosophy
With over 114 million active channels and millions of videos uploaded daily, finding genuinely engaging content is increasingly difficult. The challenge of finding quality content amidst the vast sea of videos is real. YouTube's recommendation algorithm often promotes content that doesn't necessarily align with quality or relevance. 

> YouTube's recommendation algorithm is built to ~utilise~ waste your time. (No wonder they're pushing more and more shorts into your feed.) 

**The Solution:**
A simple yet effective metric —the like-to-view ratio—proved to be a reliable indicator of video quality. A video with a high ratio generally suggests that it is well-received and potentially more valuable. This Chrome extension was created to display this ratio beside each video thumbnail, allowing users to quickly assess content before committing time to watch.

## Features

- Displays the like-to-view ratio on every YouTube video thumbnail.
- Helps quickly identify high-quality content.
- Saves time by filtering out less engaging videos.
